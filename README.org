#+DESCRIPTION: GNU Emacs Configuration Repository README.
#+LANGUAGE: en

This repository is for versioning my GNU Emacs configuration files. I hope to
keep them platform independent, so I can use them across all my machines (both
UNIX-like and Windows).

* Note

To use this configuration there should be no /~\slash{}.emacs/ file as this
configuration uses an /init.el/ that is stored in the /~\slash{}.emacs.d/
directory.  Also ensure that when cloning this repository something resembling
following command is used:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak && git clone <url> ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC
This configuration uses custom.el as the customize options settings file.

* Packages Used (MELPA)

* License

#+INCLUDE: "./LICENSE"
